ðŸ‘‹ Hi,I'm Wen Shuo Chao, a computer science graduate from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, double major in applied mathematics (First Class Honor). 
I have research experience related to Graph Neural Network, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.
Currently, I research on Knowledge Graph Embedding supervised by Prof. Mi Yen Yeh. 

My interest lies in statistical machine learning and graph neural network, including combinatorial optimization problems with graph network. 
I studied in Graph Isomorphism problem supervised by Prof. Qi Feng Chen last year.
In my sophomore year, I focused on the Computer Vision project, including Super-Resolution and Video-based Person Re-identification, supervised by Prof. Shueng Han Chan.

I'm also interested in financial modeling with experience of utilizing Vector Autoregression model for valuation of time-varying expected returns.
