ðŸ‘‹ Hi,I'm Wen Shuo Chao, a computer science graduate from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, double major in applied mathematics (First Class Honor). 
I have research experience related to Graph Neural Network, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. <br />
Currently, I research on Knowledge Graph Embedding supervised by Prof. Mi Yen Yeh. <br />

My interest lies in statistical machine learning and graph neural network, including combinatorial optimization problems with graph network. <br />
I studied in Graph Isomorphism problem supervised by Prof. Qi Feng Chen last year. <br />
In my sophomore year, I focused on the Computer Vision project, including Super-Resolution and Video-based Person Re-identification, supervised by Prof. Shueng Han Chan. <br />
I'm also interested in financial modeling with experience of utilizing Vector Autoregression model for valuation of time-varying expected returns. <br />

In my repositories, you could view most of the work I've done, if you would like to know more information about any of them, please contact me via vincent40416@gmail.com
